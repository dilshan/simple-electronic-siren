# Simple Transistor-Based Electronic Siren

This project provides a discrete transistor implementation of a multi-tone electronic siren, offering an easy-to-build and low-cost solution that replicates alarm effects found in classic two-timer NE556 siren circuits. It serves as a practical alternative to rare *UM3561* and *UM3562* sound generator ICs.

The design uses only standard *BC548* / *BC558* transistors, resistors, and capacitors—making it easy to build with commonly available components.

A full assembly and test demonstration is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mPkqBXPQGk4). Full details of this project are available at blog post in here.
